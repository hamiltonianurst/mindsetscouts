<h3>Requirements:</h3>

<ul><li>Pick three people you trust; Ask them to come up with one piece of advice or honest feedback they’d think you’d benefit from hearing.</li>
<li>Respond non-defensively, remembering that they are trying to help. Thank them when they are done.</li>
<li>Evaluate on your own whether or not the feedback was helpful. If it was, think about how you can integrate it into your life.</li></ul>
